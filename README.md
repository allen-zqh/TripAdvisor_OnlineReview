This is a repository including data&code for paper "Exploring the Voice of Inbound Tourists: A Study on the Perceived Image of Ethnic-minority Village Tourism with Impact on Satisfaction"

Abstract: The opinions and emotions expressed by tourists were the genuine perception of the destination image. To listen to the voice of inbound tourists, this research introduces a new analytical framework through two studies to explore the perceived destination image of ethnic-minority village tourism. Study 1 employed content and sentiment analyses to reveal the cognitive and affective images. Study 2 quantitatively assesses image dimensions’ impact on satisfaction using online reviews. Findings underscore that (1) the perceived destination image includes four dimensions: natural landscape, cultural attraction, tourism environment and touristic service, as well as infrastructure and facility. Eight themes were identified in the cognitive image and the affective image tends to be positive; (2) tourism environment and touristic service exerts the most pronounced impact on satisfaction. This research innovatively transformed textual data into numerical data. It enriches the literature on inbound tourism in China’s ethnic regions, providing practical insights for improving the international competitiveness of ethnic-minority villages in the post-COVID-19 era.
